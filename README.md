# Hourglass
<br/>
A 3D animated hourglass to remind you to take breaks every hour.<br/>
When time is up it will play a sound and become "always on top" until turned over.<br/>
As simple as a physical hourglass but free, unbreakable and precise.<br/>
Resizable, moveable and with transparent background (if supported by your desktop).<br/>
<br/>
Since its a HTML5 application, can be packaged to run pretty much everywhere.<br/>
The binary installer uses the NW.js HTML5 engine.<br/>
Can be run as a chrome App (no transparency), sideloaded using a launch script (chromeapp.bat).<br/>
<br/>
Can be used a web page on modern browsers (no transparency, with browser frame and decorations). For web page mode, just copy the folder into a web server. Running from local file system wont work.<br/>
<br/>
Uses Three.js, dat.gui.js and chrome APIs (when it find its, otherwise some features will be unavailable)<br/>
#Installer
I also made a NSIS config file for creating a complete Windows installer/uninstaller.<br/>
If you want to rebuild the installer, the NW.js binaries are required. Copy then to "installer/(architectury)" folder and run batch.
